# Python-Platforming-Game
This is a Python project where I try to create a 2D platforming game using the Pygame module. I will be using this tutorial by freeCodeCamp.org: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gLeplbqtqg
Once I am finished with the tutorial I will be adding additional mechanics to the game.
(IN PROGRESS)
